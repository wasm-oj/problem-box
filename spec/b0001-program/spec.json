What is a program?\n\nWhen we talk about a program, we're talking about a set of **instructions** that a computer can understand and execute.\n\nGenerally speaking, every computer instruction is doing one of two things:\n\n1. **Moving** information, such as saving text to a file or saving numbers to memory\n2. **Manipulating** information, such as adding two numbers together or replacing words in a sentence\n\nAll programs are made up of these two types of instructions. The instructions are written in a **programming language** that the computer can understand.\n\nHere's an example of a program written in C, a popular programming language:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\nint main() {\n    int a, b;\n\n    scanf(\"%d %d\", &a, &b);\n\n    int sum = a + b;\n\n    printf(\"The sum of %d and %d is %d\\n\", a, b, sum);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nThis program is doing the following:\n\n1. **Moving** information from standard input (the keyboard) into **variables** `a` and `b`.\n2. **Manipulating** information by adding `a` and `b` together and **moving** the result into a new variable `sum`.\n3. **Moving** information from the variables `a`, `b`, and `sum` to standard output (the screen).\n\n> *The actual happening behind the scene is a bit more complicated than this, but this is a good enough explanation for now.*\n\nNow, please implement a similar program, but read **three** numbers (`a`, `b`, and `c` respectively) from standard input and print the result of `a + b - c` to standard output.\n\n## Input\n\nThe first line contains three positive integers not exceeding 1000, separated by spaces.\n\n## Output\n\nPrint the result of `a + b - c` to standard output without other characters, and end with a newline (`\n`).\n","policies":[{"budget":1000000,"memory":64,"score":100}],"testcases":[{"fs":{"final":{"_stdout":"txt:0"},"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:1 2 3"}},"score":0,"sample":true,"description":"1 + 2 - 3 = 0"},{"fs":{"final":{"_stdout":"txt:299"},"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:100 200 1"}},"score":0,"sample":true,"description":"100 + 300 - 1 = 299"},{"fs":{"final":{"_stdout":"txt:10"},"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:9 8 7"}},"score":20,"sample":null,"description":null},{"fs":{"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:123 321 222"},"final":{"_stdout":"txt:222"}},"score":20,"sample":null,"description":null},{"fs":{"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:1000 1000 1000"},"final":{"_stdout":"txt:1000"}},"score":20,"sample":null,"description":null},{"fs":{"final":{"_stdout":"txt:1"},"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:1 1 1"}},"score":20,"sample":null,"description":null},{"fs":{"final":{"_stdout":"txt:-998"},"prep":{"_stdin":"txt:1 1 1000"}},"score":20,"sample":null,"description":null}]}
