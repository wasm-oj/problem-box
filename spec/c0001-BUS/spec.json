{"id":"c0001-BUS","tags":["basic"],"name":"BUS","description":"As a Busy University Student, you have to often take the bus to 本部 from 公館 campus.\nAs introduce in the 伯樂大學堂, there are 3 bus routes between 公館 and 本部.\n\nThe 3 routes are: 278, 復興幹線 and 0南. And they have different schedules.\n\nFor simplicity, we assume that the bus schedules are as follows:\n1. 278: 40 minutes per bus(Least frequent in reality)\n2. 復興幹線: 6 minutes per bus(Most frequent in reality)\n3. 0 南: 19 minutes per bus\n\nAnd the bus service 24 hours a day.(i.e. 全年無休)\n\nToday, your friend, PY, who is a Bed and Usleep(INT_MAX) Student, he just wake up and just leave 學七舍, and you are at bus stop waiting for him.\nYou want to tell him how many buses you have missed.\n\n## Input\n\nInput follow the format `D1:H1:M1`.`D1`,`H1`,`M1` are integers, where `D1` is the Day you arrive at the bus stop since 1922(the NTNU established), `H` is the hour you arrive at the bus stop, `M` is the minute you arrive at the bus stop.\nThen, the following input are `D2:H2:M2`.`D2`,`H2`,`M2` are integers, where `D2` is the Day PY arrive the bus stop since 1922(the NTNU established), `H2` is the hour PY arrive the bus stop, `M2` is the minute PY arrive the bus stop.\nIt is guaranteed that PY will arrive after you.
